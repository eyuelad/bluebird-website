              Confusion, sunken eyes, fatigue, weak skin and chopped lips could
              often be easily avoided by maintaining good hydration to the
              elderly. My 10 years close interaction with our larger family here
              at Bluebird has taught us how just drink water can help in so many
              ways.

              Welcome to Bluebird Adult Family Homes. My name is Elsa, a
              dedicated nurse with over 10 years of experience caring for aging
              adults. Since I completed my RN studies, I had focused on creating
              an enviorment where wholistic care can be provided to seniors that
              end up needing it.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
              I am a compassionate, dependable, and high-quality care is my
              calling. I remain closely involved in every part of our home to
              ensure your loved one receives the very best.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
              Part of my daily routine is to manage physician communications,
              fulfillment of new medication orders, review daily vitals, train
              our team and review our electronic charting records which actually
              families may also access. Whether the issue is memory care or
              other health decline, the additional close attention to their
              health do evidently help the elderly to enjoy every single
              engaging day here at Bluebird.
